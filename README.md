# Image to ASCII Converter #

This python script converts an image into ascii art in a couple dozen lines of code. You might want to preprocess the image in a program like Paint, GIMP or Photoshop to reduce the image size to run the ascii program faster. In addition, you also want to stretch the image horizontally a quarter of the image size because ascii symbols don't have the same width, your ascii art will look skinny if you don't stretch it. You can view the ascii art by opening your txt file in a web browser like Internet Explorer and zooming out. Have fun!
